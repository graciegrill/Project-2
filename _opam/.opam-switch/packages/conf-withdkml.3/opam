opam-version: "2.0"
synopsis: "Virtual package relying on with-dkml.exe"
description: """\
This package can only install if the with-dkml.exe program is installed in
a DKML home or a DKSDK noabi directory.

A 'file-depends' trigger will reinstall conf-withdkml when with-dkml.exe changes.

The %{conf-withdkml:location-native}% variable will be the native (Win32, Unix) location
of with-dkml.exe, while %{conf-withdkml:location-mixed}% will be the
location of with-dkml.exe using only forward slashes (/)."""
